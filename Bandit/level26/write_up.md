# Bandit Level 26

> Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

## Solution

```shell
sshpass -f "ssh_pass" ssh bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

**after we have a shell in the previous level now we are 'bandit26' so let's have the password for the next level**

```shell
ls -lh
```

```shell
./bandit27-do
```

```text
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit27-do id
```

```shell
./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
```

```text
