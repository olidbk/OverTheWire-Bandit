# Bandit Level 0

> The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Solution

**you can use 'sshpass' instead of 'ssh' and save the password level in a file**

```shell
sshpass -f "ssh_pass" ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

```shell
cat readme
```

```text
