# Bandit Level 18

> The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

## Login

```shell
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

```

## Solution

**The script will log you out so you need to add your commande with the connection.**

```shell
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
```
